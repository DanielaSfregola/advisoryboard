# SCP-002: Increase Community Members

## Proposer

Proposed by Jon Pretty, The Scala Center, 12 April 2016

## Abstract

The Scala Center Advisory Board makes recommendations to the Scala Center on
the basis of votes cast by its members. The reputation of the Scala Center, and
the perceived legitimacy in representing the community depend, in some part, on
the composition of the Advisory Board.

With only a single "community" member, representing just one seventh of the
board, it may be perceived that the board is overly dominated by commercial
interests, and it risks undermining the advice the board gives.

## Proposal

The number of community members on the board should be increased from one.

Two variants of this proposal should be considered, namely to increase the
number of community representatives on the board either,

 a. from one to two, or
 b. to a number equal to one third of the total number of representatives on
    the board, rounded down to the nearest integer

## Cost

There are no costs associated with implementing this proposal.

## Timescales

It will take approximately one month to change the wording in the Membership
Regulations document and to have this change verified by a lawyer.
