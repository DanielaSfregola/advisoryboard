# SCP-001: Scala Service Directory

## Proposer

Proposed by Jon Pretty, The Scala Center, 12 April 2016

## Abstract

Many organizations around the world are offering Scala consultancy,
outsourcing, development, training and other related services. Customers
seeking Scala work often find it difficult to discover the companies providing
these services, and furthermore to assess their capabilities in delivering
them.

## Proposal

An web-based directory of Scala service providers should be developed and made
publicly available. The directory should list businesses offering Scala-related
services in a format which should be searchable by name, location or the nature
of the services offered.

Each entry in the directory would include

 - a website link,
 - contact details,
 - a list of office locations,
 - geographical areas of business,
 - the size of the organization,
 - types of services offered (e.g. training, consultancy),
 - technology specializations

Additionally, organizations would be able to link to open-source projects they
develop, contribute to, or support in some way. It is hoped, by making such
links explicit in the directory, that it would encourage commercial
organizations to invest in open-source development as a means of promotion and
demonstrating their competence.

The directory would be pre-populated with initial known data from the largest
organizations offering Scala services, and subsequent data would be sourced
from contributions from the Scala community, in particular from the
organizations themselves.

Inclusion in the directory would not bestow any sort of endorsement from the
Scala Center upon that organization.

## Cost

The expected cost of development work is approximately 1500CHF, plus a
recurring 1000CHF/annum for maintening the website and liaising with
stakeholders to maintain the quality of its data.

## Timescales

The site should take approximately one week to develop and a further month to
collect and populate with enough data to be considered a useful resource.
