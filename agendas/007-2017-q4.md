# Scala Center Advisory Board Meeting, Q4, 2017: Agenda

As no proposals were submitted this quarter, I have replaced this section of the agenda with an open discussion. There will be no predetermined structure to this, and attendees are welcome to raise any questions they see fit to discuss with the board. However, should this time appear not be productive, I will move to finish the meeting earlier than usual.

1. Opening Remarks (Jon Pretty, Chairperson)
2. Report on Scala Center Activities (Heather Miller, Executive Director)
3. Financial Report (Heather Miller, Executive Director)
4. Community Discussion
    1. Community Feedback from Bill Venners
    2. Community Feedback from Lars Hupel
5. Open discussion (20-30 minutes)
6. Date of Next Meeting
7. Any other business
8. Closing remarks (Jon Pretty, Chairperson)

Thank you,
Jon Pretty
