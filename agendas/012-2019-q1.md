Dear Advisory Board,

Please find below the agenda for tomorrow's meeting.

At the previous meeting, Lars Hupel stepped down from his position as community representative, and since then, Sébastien has invited Rob Norris to take Lars's place on the board. Rob's position is still subject to approval from the other members, so as the second agenda item, we will quickly take a vote on whether to confirm the nomination, and if confirmed, Rob will join the meeting immediately after that.

Sébastien will also devote some time to presenting and discussing the possibility of introducing a new sponsorship tier, and in the absence of any proposals to discuss this time, I anticipate that this is where the majority of time will be spent.

Agenda
1. Opening remarks (Jon Pretty, Chairperson)
2. Vote on new community representative
3. Report on Scala Center activities (Sébastian)
4. Financial report (Sébastien)
5. Discussion of a potential new sponsorship tier (Sébastien Doeraene)
6 Community discussion (Rob Norris (TBC) and Bill Venners)
7. Date and venue of next meeting
8. Any other business
9. Closing remarks (Jon Pretty)

Thanks,
Jon
