Dear Advisory Board members,

We will hold the next advisory board meeting face-to-face with a remote video link on Tuesday, 11 June at 2pm (until approximately 4pm) at EPFL in Lausanne. You should all receive a calendar invitation shortly after this email. We will provide room details (with directions, if necessary) nearer the time.

This time turned out to be the only reasonable time to fit around the schedule of Scala Days. Regrettably, it is likely not convenient for attendees from some locations around the world. We reached out to these members, and they either accepted the time, or we received no response. We can always accept alternative representatives at the meeting if this affects any members.

The deadline for proposal submissions will be 48 hours before the start of the meeting, at 2pm on Sunday, 9 June. I will send round the agenda after that deadline.

Best wishes,

Jon
