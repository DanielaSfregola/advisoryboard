Hey folks!

Attached, please find an agenda for the advisory board meeting scheduled for December 16th at 8am PT! I will also attach the agenda to a calendar invite.

If you would like to discuss a topic, please add it to the "Any other business" section before the meeting! If you would like to make a proposal, please do so at least one week before the meeting: if the PR has not had time to be discussed (and ideally merged) before the meeting, we will likely not be able to hold a vote on it.

 Scala Center Advisory Board: 2019-Q4

Thanks,
Stu Hood
