Dear all,

Please be reminded that the next Scala Center Advisory Board meeting will take place on Friday. If you haven't yet confirmed your attendance to this calendar invitation, please do so now.

The deadline for proposals will be 12am UTC on Wednesday, 14 March, which leaves just over a day and a half to submit. We currently have just one proposal for consideration, SCP-016 regarding Accessible Scala, available to view here,

https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/blob/master/proposals/016-verbal-descriptions.md

Once the deadline for submissions has passed, I will circulate an agenda for the meeting.

Many thanks,
Jon
