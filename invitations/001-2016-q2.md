Dear Advisory Board Representative,

The first Scala Center Advisory Board meeting shall take place at on Monday, 9
May from 2pm to 4pm (EDT) in New York. The exact location shall be confirmed
shortly.

Attendance
----------

In general, for any Advisory Board meeting, all members should either:

a. attend in person,
b. attending virtually, by voice or video call,
c. nominate an alternative representative to attend in lieu, or,
d. choose to have no participation.

We have now received details about attendance from all our members.


Virtual Attendance
------------------

Some Advisory Board members will be unable to attend in person, and we shall
involve such members via video link using Google Hangouts. We will send a
calendar invitation to all attendees in good time before the meeting which will
include a link to join the meeting.


Submission of Proposals
-----------------------

Proposals for recommendation to the Advisory Board may be submitted at any
time before the meeting, but proposals submitted earlier will provide a greater
opportunity for other members to view and respond to them.

Proposals should follow the format laid out in the proposal template[1], and
should be submitted either by email to me[2], or by pull-request to the
Advisory Board repository on GitHub[3].


Proposal Constraints
--------------------

For the first Advisory Board meeting, we will be limiting the number of
proposals any member can propose to one "significant" proposal, or two "modest"
proposals.

As this will be the first opportunity of its kind for members to submit
proposals for recommendation, we expect that the number of proposals submitted
may be higher than is likely for subsequent meetings, so we want to constrain
the time spent discussing proposals to approximately ten minutes per member.

Our capacity, as a small nonprofit organization funded by our members, puts a
hard constraint on which recommendations made by the Advisory Board we are
capable of implementing within our limited means. So in order to set
expectations appropriately, we will look to conclude the first meeting with a
set of recommendations that does not exceed our capabilities.

Throughout the meeting, the Executive Director will be able to advise on the
Scala Centerâ€™s ability to undertake certain proposals, which will be an
important consideration in choosing which proposals to adopt as
recommendations, and which to reject or defer to later meetings.


Agenda
------

The agenda for the meeting, which will include the proposals for discussion,
shall be sent to all representatives approximately two working days before the
meeting.


The Meeting
-----------

The first Advisory Board meeting will be a learning process for all of us, but
we are nevertheless making every effort for the meeting to run effectively the
first time. The meetings will have a semi-formal structure, primarily to ensure
they remain focused.

Here is a brief outline of how we expect the session to run.

The meeting will open with some brief introductory words from the chairperson,
followed by reports from the Executive Director. This will be an opportunity
for the Scala Center to talk about the progress made towards our goals, and to
show off some of the work done. This should take no more than about fifteen
minutes.

We will then have a short round of elections for the three officers of the
board: chairperson, secretary and technical advisor, who will be chosen (for
subsequent meetings) from the attendees at the meeting. The first two roles
exist primarily to ensure that the Advisory Board meetings are functional, and
require no technical abilities, so we do not expect there to be much contention
over these roles. Martin Odersky will stand for the role of technical adviser.
This section of the meeting will take just a few minutes, with votes being cast
(where necessary) by a show of hands.

The main part of the meeting will be spent discussing, reviewing and voting on
proposals. Each member will be invited to present their proposal or proposals
in turn. After representations have been made for all of the proposals, the
chairperson will invite everyone to respond to each, in turn. In particular,
the Technical Advisor and Executive Director may be consulted for their
opinions on the feasibility of the proposal under discussion. Following the
discussion, the chairperson will decide for each proposal whether to
move it to a vote (which will take place by a show of hands) or defer further
discussion to a later meeting.

The meeting will conclude with any other business, choosing a date and location
for the next meeting, and some closing remarks from the chairperson.

Further Questions
-----------------

We will be happy to give advice to our members on the process. Please address
any questions in this regard to me[2].

Many thanks,
Jon
