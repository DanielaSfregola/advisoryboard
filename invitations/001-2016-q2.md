Dear Advisory Board Representative,

The first Scala Center Advisory Board meeting shall take place at on Monday, 9
May at 2pm-4pm (EDT) at [location] in New York.

Attendance
----------

If you have not already done so, please confirm by email whether,

a. you will be attending in person,
b. you will be attending virtually, by voice or video call,
c. you will nominate an alternative representative to attend in your place, or,
d. you will have no participation in this Advisory Board meeting.


Virtual Attendance
------------------

Some advisory board members will be unable to attend in person, and we shall
involve such members via video link using Google Hangouts. We will send a
calendar invitation to all attendees in good time before the meeting which will
include a link to join the meeting.


Submission of Proposals
-----------------------

Proposals for recommendation to the Advisory Board may be submitted at any
time, but the Advisory Board will only consider proposals submitted up to seven
days before the meeting. The deadline for proposals for the next meeting shall
therefore be 2pm (EDT), Monday, 2 May.

Proposals should follow the format laid out in the proposal template[1], and
should be submitted either by email to Jon Pretty[2], or by pull-request to the
Advisory Board repository on GitHub[3].


Proposal Constraints
--------------------

As this will be the first meeting of the advisory board, and the first
opportunity of its kind for members to submit proposals for recommendation, we
expect that the number of proposals submitted may be higher than is likely for
subsequent meetings.

Our capacity, as a small nonprofit organization funded by our members, puts a
hard constraint on which recommendations made by the Advisory Board we can
implement. We will therefore be seeking to conclude the first meeting having
agreed a set of recommendations commensurate with these capabilities.

The Advisory Board will consider the submitted proposals within the time we
have available during the meeting, however, in order to focus our attention on
the most important items, we are advising that each member limit their
submissions to what can be discussed within approximately ten minutes. We
expect that a proposal involving significant work is likely to take a full ten
minutes of discussion, whereas more modest proposals may be able to move to a
vote within five minutes. Effectively, this limits each member to one
significant proposal or two smaller proposals.

Throughout the meeting, the Executive Director will be able to advise on The
Scala Centerâ€™s ability to undertake certain recommendations.


Agenda
------

The agenda for the meeting, which will include the proposals for discussion,
shall be sent to all representatives approximately five days before the
meeting.

All proposals under consideration will be available to read at this time, and
we request that all attending delegates be familiar with the proposals in
advance of the meeting.

We will be happy to give advice to our members on the process. Please address
any questions in this regard to Jon Pretty[2].


Many thanks,
Jon
