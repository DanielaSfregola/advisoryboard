Dear AB members,

I would like to fix a date for the next Scala Center Advisory Board meeting. As usual, the meeting will take place at 4pm (London time) to try to accommodate both European and US West Coast attendees.

This will be the eighth meeting, but looking ahead five months to the ninth meeting, traditionally we would aim for this to be a non-virtual meeting, colocated with Scala Days. Although this has not been confirmed, aiming to pick a date roughly half-way between the previous meeting and Scala Days North America on June 19-21, I have proposed nine dates in March. Please select which of these you are available for using the Doodle tool, here:

I will aim to make the decision approximately one week from now. As usual I will do my best to accommodate everyone, but will give priority to key attendees.

Proposals are welcome, and I encourage board members to make these earlier rather than later, to allow plenty of time for discussion to take place before the meeting.

Seth has written up the minutes from the last AB meeting, and these will be published very soon.

Many of you also attended the Scala LSP meeting a week ago. Just to reassure interested parties, I am in the process of writing up the minutes and a corresponding blog, and hope to send an update in the next few days.

Many thanks,
Jon Pretty
