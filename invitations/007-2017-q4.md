Dear all,

I would like to arrange a date for the next advisory board meeting, which is scheduled to take place approximately three months since the last one. The last meeting was delayed a little to avoid vacations in August, so the next meeting will be scheduled for some time the first two weeks of December.

Regardless of the selected day, the meeting will be a conference call, taking place 4-6pm UTC, which corresponds to at 8am start in San Francisco and (hopefully) a 7pm finish in Lausanne. Please follow the link below to register your preferences for which dates you can attend:

(Please reply directly to me if you are unable to access Doodle, letting me know which dates, from weekdays between 1 and 12 September inclusive, are acceptable to you, and I'll update your preferences.)

Thanks to Seth, we have also published the minutes from the last meeting, which are available to view here:

Proposals should be submitted through the usual process, and as always, I'm happy to provide advice on this.

Thanks,
Jon Pretty
