Dear all,

I would like to leave organizing the next Advisory Board meeting a little less late next time: a few sponsors have been unable to attend recently, so I would like to offer everyone a bit more notice to try to maximize attendance.

If I recall correctly, we agreed at the last meeting to schedule the next meeting for the first half of December, so as to avoid the week of Christmas, so I have suggested a broad selection of times in the poll below:

Please follow the link and share your availability. I will do my best to accommodate everyone's requirements. Anyone who has not replied in a week or so will get a reminder from me!

Also, please be reminded that Scala Center proposals may be submitted at any time. This enables more discussion to happen prior to the meeting, and means that the proposals which arise for discussion during the meeting are more likely to be in a good state for acceptance.

In particular, this could have avoided the situation at the last meeting where we considered rejecting a proposal so as to have the opportunity to vote on an alternative, whose details had not (at that time) been discussed.

I will therefore make the deadline for new proposals 14 days before the next scheduled meeting, but will introduce the possibility for anyone to submit a variation on a proposal (but not new proposals) up to 7 days before the meeting, thereby offering a full week of discussion in which a proposal may be refined.

I hope this will represent an improvement in the overall proposal and voting process.

Many thanks,
Jon
