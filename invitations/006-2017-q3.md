Dear all,

I would like (preferably before the end of this week) to arrange a date for the next advisory board meeting, which is scheduled to take place approximately three months since the last one. As dates in August often have to contend with vacations, we will allow this meeting to slip a little to the first two weeks of September to try to maximize attendance.

Regardless of the selected day, the meeting will be a conference call, taking place 3-5pm UTC. Please follow the link below to register your preferences for which dates you can attend:

(Please reply directly to me if you are unable to access Doodle, letting me know which dates, from weekdays between 4 and 14 September, are acceptable to you, and I'll update your preferences.)

Thanks to Seth, we have also published the minutes from the last meeting, which are available to view here:

Thanks,
Jon Pretty
