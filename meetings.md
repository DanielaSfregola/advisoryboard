# Advisory Board Meetings

This document collects advice and experiences on how to conduct
advisory board meetings.  It's intended for use by the chair (or
acting chair) and the secretary.

## Chairing

Some miscellaneous advice, in no particular order, and much of it is
perhaps obvious anyway:

### Before

* Send out the meeting agenda a few days ahead of time, to give
  the board time to consider topics in advance.
* The chair or secretary should also upload the agenda to
  https://github.com/scalacenter/advisoryboard/tree/master/agendas
* Before the meeting begins, review the agenda and arrive at a rough
  idea of how long each part of the meeting should take, in order to
  fit everything in.

### Starting

* Before beginning the meeting, start the recording.
* Make sure the recording clearly indicates who was present and
  which board members were absent, if any.

## Director's Report

* Encourage and invite engagement from board members during the director's
  report.  The report needn't be a long unbroken monologue.

### Moderating

* Let the conversation flow when there's plenty of time; apply
  pressure when there's not.
* There will be people connecting remotely, who won't feel as
  connected, so make sure they have every opportunity to join in, and
  check regularly that they're still connected.
* Invite specific people to talk if you think they might offer a
  different perspective.  (This includes asking the technical advisor
  for input, if appropriate.)
* Ask for clarification whenever someone says something which may
  not be as widely understood as they presume.

### Procedural

* There will be votes. Make sure the secretary captures the votes, or
  put them into a spreadsheet.  Pause the meeting if necessary to make
  sure that votes have been accurately recorded.
* On procedural matters, don't be afraid to make ad-hoc decisions as
  needed.  The rules were written without knowing how things would
  actually work out in practice. The rules are there for our
  collective benefit if you need to refer to them, but if you need to
  make a practical decision for the obvious benefit of moving forward
  with the meeting, do it. You only need to be extra-careful and
  extra-correct if someone might be upset by the decision.

## Notes and Minutes

Being secretary mainly just means producing minutes afterwards and
updating the advisoryboard repo on GitHub. For producing minutes,
it's best to have a recording of the meeting to refer to (ideally
video, but audio is better than nothing).

But technology can't be trusted, so it's best for the secretary (or
someone they ask to help) takes notes live, too, especially when there
is voting, so if the recording doesn't turn out, we can produce some
kind of minutes without having to reconstruct everything from memory.

The live notes needn't be detailed, it's not necessary to pound away
at your keyboard the whole time like a court stenographer, just hit
the high points and make sure you get concrete things like votes,
action items that arise, etc.  Interrupt the meeting if necessary to
ask for clarification.
